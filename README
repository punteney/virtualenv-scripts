Basic scripts I use in conjunction with virtualenvwrapper to setup
my working environments.

These scripts assume your virtualenvs are in ~/.virtualenvs and
that your project folders are at ~/projects/ and named the same
as the virtualenv you create.

To use the scripts just download them and run the install.sh 
script which will link the scripts or else just copy the scripts
directly into the ~/.virtualenvs folder
